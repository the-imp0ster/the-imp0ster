## Hey there, I'm Imp0ster.

![Mfer 7332](mfer-7332_250.png)

I'm a baby web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

### Web Programmer

I build mainly with front-end web languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript).   
I've written basic apps using Java (ü§Æ) and basic back-ends with SQL (‚ù§Ô∏è) and C# (‚ù§Ô∏è).  
I also tinker with Python and Solidity, both of which I adore.

### Veteran

I spent almost 8 years in the Royal Canadian Navy, first as a stoker then in a tactical specialist role.  
I "retired" in 2017 at Master Seaman (now Master Sailor).  
I miss going to sea, but I don't miss the bullshit.

### Yogi

Daily mindfulness and movement practices have likely saved my life.

### Human Multi-Tool

I'm not spitting my CV out here but you probably want me on your apocalypse team rather than off it.




### Anyway, I hope you find a fun little project here to tinker around with.

## Thanks for stopping by! ‚ù§Ô∏è
