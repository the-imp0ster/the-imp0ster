## Hey there, I'm Imp0ster.

I'm a web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I build mainly with front-end web languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript).   
I've written basic apps using Java (ü§Æ) and basic back-ends with SQL (‚ù§Ô∏è) and C# (‚ù§Ô∏è).  
I also tinker with Python and Solidity.

I do a bunch of other shit and I love learning new things and creating stuff within the most hellish of constraints and challenging myself.  

### I hope you find a fun little project here to tinker around with, and feedback on my projects is always welcome.

You can find me on Twitter using the link in my profile.

## Thanks for stopping by! ‚ù§Ô∏è
