hey there, i'm imp0ster.

i'm a full stack web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

i usually build with javascript et al. but i have experience with other web frameworks and languages including asp.net, java (❤️), python, and sql (❤️).

i love solving problems and creating stuff even within the most hellish of constraints.

### i'm currently working on:

* **[mferwind css](https://github.com/the-imp0ster/mferwind-css)**: a growing custom css library for creating websites with an mferish aesthetic.  i'm really stoked about building this out and it's already fully-functioning and easy to use as-is even though i still have a lot of important things to add to it.  mferwind css is not yet an npm package but you're welcome to try the library or adapt it for use in your own projects. demo and docs can be found [here](https://mferwind-css.vercel.app/).

* **[vectors & physics in a browser](https://github.com/the-imp0ster/p5-sheep-art)**: specifically, modelling the organic movement of a flock of sheep on an html canvas using p5.js to apply "forces" (rules) that influence the flock's movements.  my most recent update now has a wolf that chases the sheep around and they respond realtime.  i am now adding bezier curves to some of the force applications for smoother obstacle avoidance (rocks and the edges of the canvas).  next i'd like to explore modelling wave movements and sea state, possibly using matter.js or another physics library.

### thanks for stopping by ❤️
