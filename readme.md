## Hey there, I'm Imp0ster ‚ù§Ô∏è

![Mfer 7332](mfer.png)


I'm a baby web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

At the moment, I build mainly with front-end web languages (HTML/CSS/Javascript).   
I also tinker  with Python and Solidity and have written basic apps using Java (ü§Æ) and basic back-ends with SQL (‚ù§Ô∏è) and C# (‚ù§Ô∏è).
