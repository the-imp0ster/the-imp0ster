## Hey there, I'm Imp0ster.

I'm a web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I currently build mainly front-end goodies and mostly with Javascript, where I can usually be found swimming around in React and p5.js.  
I've written other goodies with Java (❤️) and Python, and some back-end and database-y stuff as well with SQL (❤️), C#, and... Javascript (❤️).  

I love learning and creating stuff even within the most hellish of constraints.  

Feedback on my projects is always welcome.

You can find me on Twitter using the link in my profile.

### I hope you find a fun project or idea here to create with, thanks for stopping by! ❤️
