## Hey there, I'm Imp0ster.

I'm a web programmer, a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I currently build mainly with front-end web languages.   
I've written basic apps using Java (ü§Æ) and Python (‚ù§Ô∏è), and basic back-ends with SQL (‚ù§Ô∏è) and C# (‚ù§Ô∏è).  
I also write small (but growing üå±) programs with Solidity.

I love learning and creating stuff even within the most hellish of constraints.  

### I hope you find a fun project or idea here to create with, and feedback on my projects is always welcome.

You can find me on Twitter using the link in my profile.

## Thanks for stopping by! ‚ù§Ô∏è
